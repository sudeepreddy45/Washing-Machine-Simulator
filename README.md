# Washing-Machine-Simulator
An Embedded Systems project simulating a real-world washing machine using **PIC16F877A**, **Embedded C**, and **PicsimLab**.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Embedded C (Register-level programming)
- PIC16F877A Microcontroller
- MPLAB X IDE + XC8 Compiler
- PicsimLab for simulation
- FSM (Finite State Machine) based architecture

## 🔧 Features Implemented
- ✅ Power-On via Keypad
- ✅ 10+ Wash Modes (Daily, Heavy, Woolens, Dry Only, etc.)
- ✅ Water Level Selection (Auto, Low, Medium, High, Max)
- ✅ Start/Pause/Stop Control
- ✅ Door Status Detection (with buzzer alerts)
- ✅ CLCD Real-Time Display (function + remaining time)
- ✅ End-of-Cycle Notification ("Remove Clothes")

## 🧠 Learning Outcomes
- Direct register-level control with Embedded C
- Peripheral interfacing: Keypad, LCD, buzzer, sensors
- FSM design for state-based logic flow
- Real-time embedded simulation and debugging
